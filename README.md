# wac-network-midi
MaxMSP patch for transmitting MIDI between computers over a network

## Use
- Install [Max MSP](https://cycling74.com/products/max/) on your Windows/OS X computer
  - Note the 'free trial' of Max MSP is sufficient to run this patch
- Download this code
- Open `wacNetworkMIDI.maxpat` in the Max application
- Follow the instructions in the [documentation](./wacNetworkMIDIInstructions.pdf) to use the patch

## History

I used to distribute this as a standalone app (generated from Max MSP). I figured distributing the patch directly saves me having to maintain those standalones to keep up with operating system updates. It also means more people are free to see/adapt the Max code if they so wish
